A imaging black holes
=============================
** An introduction into imaging black holes

It is very difficult to take a photo of a black hole. You need a giant telescope the size of the Earth to do this.

Instead scientists use many telescopes around the world to take images of parts of a black hole.

They then create software to reconstruct the image of the black hole. A collaborative effort from researchers with different expertise is needed.

A day without radiation is a day without sunshine.
