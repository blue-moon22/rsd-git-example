A imaging black holes
=============================
** An introduction into imaging black holes

A black hole is a singularity, where matter has collapsed into an infinitely small point in space.
Gravity is so strong around a black hole that, once too close, nothing can escape its pull, not even light. 
Hot gas around a black hole is heated to hundreds of billions of degrees and glows brightly.
It is very difficult to take a photo of a black hole. You need a giant telescope the size of the Earth to do this.
Instead scientists use many telescopes around the world to take images of parts of a black hole.
They then create software to reconstruct the image of the black hole. A collaborative effort from researchers with different expertise is needed.
Dr Katie Bouman from MIT was the first person to reconstruct a black hole. She used software that was built by her and collaborators.
The site below contains some cool black holes/string [simulation videos](http://www.grchombo.org/movies).

Why did the Black Hole get arrested?

It committed mass murder
